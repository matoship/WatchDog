### Task Understanding: Key Takeaways - Sensors Module

**1. Developing a tracking system:**
* To monitor persons entering and exiting a room (Tracking patient mainly).
+ Able to identify the motion of patient (gets out of a bed/chair - stable to motion state).
+ Able to send signal based on allowed movements for particular patient Id.

  `Given Scenarios:`
  + Scenario 1: Patients can get out of bed but not leave the room.
  - Scenario 2: Patients may not be allowed to get out of bed.<br/><br/>
  
  `Additional Scenarios:`
  * Scenario 3: Checking whether patient fell on the floor (Scenario where patient has fainted suddenly, add on for Scenario 1).

- Components: Raspberry Pi, Grid-eye
